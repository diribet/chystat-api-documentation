# AQDEF upload API

Using this REST API a client is able to upload an AQDEF file to the [chy.stat](https://www.chystat.com) application.
Note that the AQDEF upload API is designed to be asynchronous. It means when you post an AQDEF file,
there is no guaranteed time when the file will be uploaded by the chy.stat uploading system.

## What is AQDEF

AQDEF stands for Advanced Quality Data Exchange Format.
It is a data format developed by Q-DASÂ® in cooperation with leading companies of the manufacturing industry.

We are providing an open-source Java library for working with this format. See [aqdef-tools](https://github.com/diribet/aqdef-tools) for more information.

## Authentication

For authentication we are using [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io).
Note that there is no login mechanism in chy.stat API where the client would obtain a token, so the client is responsible for generating the token itself.
The token must meet some specific criteria, otherwise the request will be rejected with an appropriate [response](#response).

We are expecting the token in a form of Base64 encoded strings joined together as 

`Bearer Base64(Header).Base64(Payload).Base64(Signature)`

The keyword `Bearer` is part of the JWT specification, so we are following it.
The token must be sent in `Authorization` request header. See [request parameters](#request-parameters) section below.

#### JWT Header

Header is a standard JWT header where is defined the token type and an algorithm used to create its signature. 

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### JWT Payload

Payload must contain a standard claim called `iat` - Issuaed At. It's a [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) representing time 
where the token was created. It will be used for validating the token age. By default we reject tokens older than 10 minutes.

```json
{
  "iat": 1504783221
}
```

#### JWT Signature

We accept only HS256 algorithm used for signing the token.

## Request

There is only one available URL for the AQDEF upload API - **api/upload**

We are expecting here a multipart POST requests with appropriate [request parameters](#request-parameters) when uploading AQDEF files.

### Request parameters

Header

Parameter      | Required        | Content example
-------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorization  | **required**    | Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci.e30.0LHZndaAoGVj7BDgj8wHRqR7ApyJpXc

Body (multipart/form)

Parameter      | Required        | Content example
-------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------
datasourceId   | **required**    | 31944cd8-fab8-4b0d-a866-39e82d7ce40d
aqdefFile      | **required**    | 
path           | **required**    | AP125/B02/test.DFQ
charset        | optional        | cp1250

#### Authorization

Contains JWT. To create its signature part you need to use the HS256 algorithm with a secret key. To get that key you need to

- login to a chy.stat application with admin rights
- go to section **System settings** :arrow_right: **General** :arrow_right: **Upload**
- select a target **Upload**
- go to its **Data Sources** tab and select or create an API datasource

#### datasourceId

The datasource to which is client uploading files to. 
To get that ID follow instructions from [Authorization header](#authorization) above.

#### aqdefFile

It's the uploaded file itself.

#### path

When uploading an AQDEF file, you can tell a relative path where the file will be read from at the server side.
The path **MUST** at least contain name of the file. This is the most common scenario.

#### charset

Character encoding used for AQDEF file encoding. Default is UTF-8.

#### An example POST request

```
POST /chystat/api/upload HTTP/1.1
Host: my.domain.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci.e30.0LHZndaAoGVj7BDgj8wHRqR7ApyJpXc
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW

------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="datasourceId"

31944cd8-fab8-4b0d-a866-39e82d7ce40d
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="aqdefFile"; filename="test.DFQ"
Content-Type: 

------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="path"

AP125/B02/test.DFQ
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--
```

## Response

Since the AQDEF upload API is designed to be asynchronous, we provide only two type of response.

- HTTP 200 OK - upload request has been accepted and the file will be uploaded as soon as possible
- HTTP 40x/50x - upload request has been rejected

In case of rejection, the response contains a JSON body with an specific API [error code](#error-codes) and a message.

```json
{
  "code": 110,
  "message": "Unknown datasource ID"
}
```

## Error codes

Table of API error codes and its meaning.

Code  | HTTP status code  | Name                      | Description
----- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
0     | 500               | General error             | General error where no specific code can't be used.
